// PROMPt: Implement a linked list. A singly-linked list is a data structure that holds a sequence of linked nodes.
// Each node, in turn, contains data and a pointer, which can point to another node.

const Node = data => {
  this.data = data
  this.next = null
}

const linkedList = () => {
  this.length = 0
  // number of nodes in the Linked List
  this.head = null
  // a pointer to the first node at the front of the list
}
